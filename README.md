# Componentize

A CSS Component System Project

### Pre-Work

If you're not finished with the ToDOM project, you may not get points for it, but I highly advise finishing, as this and other projects are based on it. Only check the solution if you absolutely need to!


### Your Task

Take your ToDOM project and Componentize it! There's a list of component systems below, and you'll pick ONE and apply it to your app in two steps:

1. Add classes to as many of your **current** HTML elements as you can to make them look _fancy_.

2. Add all-new components to your page by making some html and giving it the classes given to you by your component system.


### How To Get Started

Pick a component system from the list, include its CSS in your HTML, and throw some classes on there!


### Okay, That List, Then

* [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)


### Stretch Goal

Add your own CSS _on top_ of theirs. How do you do that? Just add CSS to the class they have! Load your CSS file in _after_ theirs, and your CSS will be further down and will apply and overwrite anything they have there. Don't like the color of a button? Add a new color! Want all buttons to have more shadow? Add that! Go bananas and go ham and go any food you want.
